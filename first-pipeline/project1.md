# A simple jenkins pipeline to verify if the docker agent configuration is working as expected.

Certainly! Let's break down the Jenkins pipeline in simpler terms:

### Jenkins Pipeline Explanation:

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - The `pipeline` block defines a set of instructions for Jenkins to follow.
   - The `agent` block says, "Hey Jenkins, when you run my code, please use an environment that has Node.js version 16 installed." It specifies the Docker image 'node:16-alpine,' which is like a pre-packaged setup with Node.js.

2. **Defining the Task:**
   - The `stages` block organizes your tasks into different stages. In this case, there's a single stage called 'Test.'

3. **Describing the Task Steps:**
   - Inside the 'Test' stage, the `steps` block says, "Here are the steps I want you to follow when running the 'Test' stage."
   - The `sh 'node --version'` command instructs Jenkins to run a shell command, specifically, to print the version of Node.js to the console.

### Putting it All Together:

When you run this pipeline in Jenkins:

- Jenkins fetches an environment with Node.js 16 (like preparing a specific kitchen for cooking).
- It goes through the 'Test' stage (like following a recipe).
- In the 'Test' stage, it prints the Node.js version to the console (like showing the result of cooking).

So, in simpler terms, your Jenkins pipeline is like a recipe for Jenkins to prepare a kitchen, follow a set of steps, and show you the result. It helps automate and organize the process of running your Node.js code in a consistent environment.
